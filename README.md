# Pigmentation

This code is part of a patented process that determines biological properties of the skin from an image and adjusts a topical product
formulation based on the user response to an applied dose of product. Here the algorithm tracks progress in eliminating a pigmentation spot 
when a proprietary formulation is applied. The methodology detects the pixels within the spot (pigmented skin) and those outside the spot (normal skin) and tracks the difference
in skin color between the normal and pigmented skin over the application period.
